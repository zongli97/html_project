# MIS2402 â€“ HTML Project
Overview: 

Starting with the source text found here ( http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html ) create a web site that is useful, informative, and/or fun. Use your knowledge of HTML and CSS that you learned from the LinkedInLearning videos assigned at the start of the semester.

Use only the resources found in the assigned LinkedInLearning HTML video material. Your solution should not contain frameworks, themes, etc. that are not in that video tutorial.

Another useful resource is W3 Schools ( https://www.w3schools.com/html/ ) You might want to use W3 Schools for a quick reference. But remember, in this project you are limited to the contents of the LinkedInLearning HTML video material.
